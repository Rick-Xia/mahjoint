**This project is under construction**

### Overview
This is the React-style Single-Page-App version of [Mahjong-Point-Calculator](https://github.com/Rick-Xia/Mahjong-scoring-tool). The project involves using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [material.ui](https://material-ui.com/), [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for development, styling, and publishing.
[Jest.js](https://jestjs.io/) is used for testing, which comes with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is also slightly involved, for generating that little interactive bar chart.

~~The main functions are still in development, and~~ this readme will keep being updated.

The main function is now finished, now the program is usable and can return correct result in most situations. Right now I am working on improving the visual effect of the whole App. Currently it doesn't look appealing. The style guildline is following the [Google's material design](https://material.io/design/introduction/).


### Progress & Future Plan
The progress of this project and future plan is:

~~construct layout~~ -> ~~create DOM components~~ -> ~~add user-interactive logics~~ -> ~~add basic style to component~~ -> ~~develope main function~~ -> finish styling -> add more features...

For __more features__, my plan is to add:

~~Yaku apperance frequency stat~~(finished), mobile platform support, multiple language support, mahjong rule look up, A logo...

May add more when I get more interesting ideas.
