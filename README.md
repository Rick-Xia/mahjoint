**This project is under construction**

This is the React-style Single-Page-App version of [Mahjong-Point-Calculator](https://github.com/Rick-Xia/Mahjong-scoring-tool). The project involves using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [material.ui](https://material-ui.com/), [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) for development, styling, and publishing.
[Jest.js](https://jestjs.io/) is used for unit tests, which comes with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is also slightly involved, for generating that little interactive bar chart.

~~The main functions are still in development~~, and this readme will keep being updated.
The main function is finished, now the programme is usable and can return correct result in most situation. Right now I am working on improving the visual effect of the whole App. Currently it doesn't look appealing. The style guildline is [Google's material design](https://material.io/design/introduction/)

The progress of this project and future plan is:
~~construct layout~~ -> ~~create DOM components~~ -> ~~add user-interactive logics~~ -> ~~add basic style to component~~ -> ~~develope main function~~ -> finish styling -> add more features...

For __more features__, my plan is to add:
~~Yaku apperance frequency stat~~(finished), multiple language support, mahjong rule look up...
May add more when I get idea

You can preview the current progress at [here](https://rick-xia.github.io/mahjoint/), which is powered by gh-pages package for create-react-app
